#data columns and rows from excel need to be noted somehow, because factors are being included in the data matrix
#maybe use formula and get excell to do the multiplication rather than step by step
#summary, pairs and other commands work well, but means are not true means due to excel problem
#also how to remove duplicate values not duplicate rows and columns as there are none
