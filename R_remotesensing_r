#now we plot, same function again, but we have 4 mill pixels

Exercise  Exercise: plot the final band, namely the NIR, band number 4

#band 4, the color scheme is called RGB used by computers to show colors and depending on how much red, etc. now lets combine this image of layers and put
#corresponding component  in RGB space we put blue band 1, band 2 green etc.
#plot RGB(), we take multilayer and use RGR scheme and we will stretch, define the bands and colors and stretch, stretch"Lin"
dev.off()
plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=2, b=1, stretch="Lin")
#but we cut this area and try to see a region that we can't with our eye, so we can use 3 bands to see image better, 3 bands, 3 components, only RGB space
#so we use B1, b2, b3 for now let's shift, by one towards b4 nir, but get rid of one, we need to shift and not use 1
dev.off() so we eliminated blue, 1 in shift, and now we see all vegetatino in red, we can see the areas where no Vegetation, important to know the landscape we see!
plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=2, b=1, stretch="Lin")

#Nice we see the pattern like lungs, to create open spaces for ecosystem exchange and access,
#so we can choose which bands we want where, we know 4 is NIR, so let's make it green now, where it was red in the code, see 76-79

#so it is a standard, b1=blue, etc. all landsat data is defined in this way , I can put NIR in red band or others if I want, it is reflective in other ways
#Natural colors, false colors, how they differ, seems need to protect the data uplink and downlink from hacking or misleading, which leads to mistakes
#best is a camera, if not possible then data from satelites and secure the heck out of it, in and out
#try to save image again even though Windows doesn't want to...
