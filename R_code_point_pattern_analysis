#Point Pattern analysis

#Install spatstat, did it, something went well

#Populations spread, clumped etc. remember discussion on population
#copy in GIT up
#Now let's see the density of covid on planet

#let's make a planar point  pattern in spatstat
attach(covid)
#ppp(() so we need lon x coor, y is lat, to call in , here we are making parameters and use c to make array
names(covid)  # x,y, ranges
covid_planar <- ppp(lon, lat,c(-180, 180), -90,90))
#Now we have longi, lat and ranges and how to know ranges

#density()
density_map <- density(covid_planar)
plot(density_map)

#now use points with planar to see the points on map
density_map <-density(covid_planar)
#color, we can change 
cl <- colorRampPalette(c('yellow','orange','red'))(100) #then replot
plot(density_map, col=cl)
#points in plt again, always redo
points(covid_planar)  #can see these in R info to get all colors

#Putting the countries ontop of map
install.packages("rgdal")

#so this red plus means I did not finish the function and need to close it!

#his code tomorrow
